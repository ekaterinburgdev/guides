## About

We are creating a unified knowledge base about Ekaterinburg that is easy to learn, develop, and enhance. Instead of the long formatting of cumbersome PDF files, standards authors write them in a user-friendly web interface, saving readers time on searching and downloading files.

For the first version of the guides, projects workis with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as CMS. Notion is a user-friendly editor with various features and [public API](https://developers.notion.com/).
